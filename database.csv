61eab22982a4667b25890db6,was trying to do a type guard/predicted and wondering why it was't working. there's an error in the official (deprecated?) docs though: code: error:,2022-01-21 13:16:25.932000+00:00

617a74b1fb8ca0572beb241a,the project from which you import your library... does it also have as a dependency ? as well as its type definitions ?,2021-10-28 10:00:17.578000+00:00
617a75aa9d20982e4fe7c8d2,no this is exactly what i prefer to avoid,2021-10-28 10:04:26.847000+00:00

617cb0408c019f0d0b65688b,my suspicion is that to would need typeclasses or something like them to make that work,2021-10-30 02:38:56.082000+00:00
