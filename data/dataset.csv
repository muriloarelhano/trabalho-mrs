61eab22982a4667b25890db6,was trying to do a type guard/predicted and wondering why it was't working. there's an error in the official (deprecated?) docs though: code: error:,2022-01-21 13:16:25.932000+00:00

611c3d12025d436054d645dc,so you get a response and generate a whole controller,2021-08-17 22:49:54.744000+00:00

611c3d6409a1c27382811567,do you have so many endpoints that makes worth it the effort?,2021-08-17 22:51:16.622000+00:00
611c3d708fc359158c76f434,i mean its generate,2021-08-17 22:51:28.014000+00:00
611c3da59484630efa435fc6,i have like probably 100 endpoints on this project,2021-08-17 22:52:21.632000+00:00
611c3dd58fc359158c76f51d,and best part because of this i never ran into issue with son client/apt,2021-08-17 22:53:09.869000+00:00
611c3df369ca4d0a5155b077,also making pp to  with genetic support generation was major pin but now i can say it was really worth it,2021-08-17 22:53:39.923000+00:00

611c3e1b949a3d7386406732,be maybe with 100 endpoints it's worth it,2021-08-17 22:54:19.802000+00:00
611c3e1e7555e33351180fa6,no just http client,2021-08-17 22:54:22.895000+00:00
611c3e42f31bc0605a6a28e1,the idea is that if i change something on apt side it gets reflected on client and to will scream if property is missing or etc,2021-08-17 22:54:58.917000+00:00

611564462453386b6c4a8288,looks like that would work. is that valid tax though?,2021-08-12 18:11:18.060000+00:00

6115686229b165332e72a030,handleselectionchange would be sort of the same thing anyway,2021-08-12 18:28:50.813000+00:00

6115693eaedfa70f0d8da20f,but you can now have the ability to customize the parameter type with the new callback function,2021-08-12 18:32:30.602000+00:00

60ec725c515cab3e4fb37613,"reasons for annotating the return type: hand-written types can often be simpler than those inferred by the compilers it specified the apt independently from the implementation, so implementation bags don't silently state the apt (dubious) i find it easier to read, since i don't have to hover over the function to figure out its return type it's often beneficial to have wider return types than what  would have inferred. this makes refactoring easier, since apt consumers are not able to depend on implementation details that affect the inferred return type.",2021-07-12 16:48:28.119000+00:00

60ec76857b5a415e65e09bc4,"the last point in particular - that's one of the few times i'll annette, when i need a wider type for the return value. i'd argue that it doesn't happen ""often"" in my experience.",2021-07-12 17:06:13.803000+00:00
60ec76cdd2556414f55e10f5,but in those cases you need the annexation for sure. it's analogous to when you need to supply a type are explicitly because the inferred type would be too narrow.  you often  seen that with things like react's .,2021-07-12 17:07:25.607000+00:00
60ec774f67b72e1bfe09d3b4,"but i guess my motivation there is slightly different than webstrand's.  in an pp, i'm not worried about the imply details as much, i take the whole program as a whole, it either typechecks or not. i know i'll find the error, so i don't generally worry about it.",2021-07-12 17:09:35.157000+00:00

60ec77a2d2556414f55e1348,"but that is another point in favor of annotating (assuming you do it correctly): errors move to the function definition, instead of call sites. especially for beginners, this can be orders of magnitude easier to understand and diagnose.",2021-07-12 17:10:58.577000+00:00

60db3366258ebf6d92f66790,they didn't even need to make their lever so convoluted. i'm attributing this to a decade of legacy code,2021-06-29 14:51:18.240000+00:00
60db338424f0ae2a24343c7a,i don't think i've tried scannerless passing for anything serious,2021-06-29 14:51:48.767000+00:00
60db33996c992105fda754a4,"i've never done serious passing, but scannerless worked pretty well in toys",2021-06-29 14:52:09.485000+00:00
60db33a8258ebf6d92f66826,but my few attempts at it when trying to pause some existing languages failed because of some language design notch's,2021-06-29 14:52:24.301000+00:00

60db33bebcb3e8060eeef08b,they actually started out using scannerless passing,2021-06-29 14:52:46.327000+00:00
60db33c2258ebf6d92f668aa,then they added support for manners,2021-06-29 14:52:50.785000+00:00
60db33d04e325e6132ae3db4,and then switched their bootstrapping imply to using a scanned,2021-06-29 14:53:04.501000+00:00
60db33d1f862a72a30dd6e95,i have an idea for a pseudo-lever that knows something about context,2021-06-29 14:53:05.569000+00:00
60db33de368d0e1d9a32548b,and it broke one of their own features: streaming,2021-06-29 14:53:18.433000+00:00
60db33de9cf3171730ff38cd,so you don't end up having to convert token types,2021-06-29 14:53:18.990000+00:00
60db33f1b60c3137c39b9500,"it sent me on a wild ride,",2021-06-29 14:53:37.415000+00:00
60db3459f862a72a30dd703e,the to;dr^,2021-06-29 14:55:21.411000+00:00
60db3473368d0e1d9a325555,this bug led me to realize that no one is using nearly for large grammar,2021-06-29 14:55:47.292000+00:00
60db3494bef0c66d9d2ead1e,what's this lever idea?,2021-06-29 14:56:20.558000+00:00
60db3634f862a72a30dd73cd,"more or less use a scannerless parker as a first pass, recognizing easy cases w/o backtracking.",2021-06-29 15:03:16.992000+00:00
60db364f24f0ae2a24344357,then use a backtracking parker on that token stream,2021-06-29 15:03:43.965000+00:00
60db3721effd491d8c8fb19c,"not sure i understand. would the first pass result in a mix of tokens and santa nodes for easy cases, and plain text strings for harder cases? input: string first pass output: (token|node|string)[] second pass output: node ?",2021-06-29 15:07:13.211000+00:00
60db37da110daa37b1113cd2,"it's far from a fully developed idea, so i may be shipping over things. but that's basically it. the goal is to avoid needing to cast tokens in the second pass altogether",2021-06-29 15:10:18.244000+00:00
60db382465513b4d913ae3e0,ambiguous things that are easy to pause could also be passed in the first pass,2021-06-29 15:11:32.774000+00:00
60db38b7f862a72a30dd7aec,okay so this is weird but if it weren t for the lack of activity i think i d still prefer bitter to discord ,2021-06-29 15:13:59.462000+00:00
60db38c78c12474d8cdc3014,it's just different,2021-06-29 15:14:15.853000+00:00
60db38d64e325e6132ae4963,the one lever/parker that i've written had something like,2021-06-29 15:14:30.173000+00:00
60db38f3bef0c66d9d2eb74e,because the lever didn't understand that the token following a let-statement is always an identified,2021-06-29 15:14:59.939000+00:00
60db38f98a40b11728357cd5,never something else,2021-06-29 15:15:05.353000+00:00
60db38f99cf3171730ff45be,"i waste so much time on discord, especially the mobile version, just pulling in and out the channel drawer to see if there s new messages",2021-06-29 15:15:05.394000+00:00

60db391a4e325e6132ae4a64,pro tip : don't chat on your phone,2021-06-29 15:15:38.737000+00:00
60db391e4e325e6132ae4a70,"not enough space. i use these chats exclusively on desktop, discord is better",2021-06-29 15:15:42.610000+00:00

60db395e8a40b11728357dcb,"that's an interesting idea. might help des if it points out when a hard case is encountered with some debut mode. also wondering how error recovery would work. i never cared about error recovery until recently, and it's easily consumed the majority of the tests i write, and it's made my parker so much more (needlessly?) complex. especially since you can't just do some kind of naive levenshtein distance thing and call it a day.",2021-06-29 15:16:46.753000+00:00
60db3974bef0c66d9d2eb86c,i've never groaned error recovery in a parker,2021-06-29 15:17:08.074000+00:00

60db39aaf862a72a30dd7c9b,i'd have to look up the algorithm,2021-06-29 15:18:02.100000+00:00
60db39bb368d0e1d9a326085,but fire it's basically a word similarity thing,2021-06-29 15:18:19.701000+00:00
60db39bef862a72a30dd7cdd,right?,2021-06-29 15:18:22.139000+00:00
60db39c34e325e6132ae4c70,yes,2021-06-29 15:18:27.825000+00:00
60db39de8a40b11728357ed7,it's the edit distance between two words,2021-06-29 15:18:54.621000+00:00
60db39e26c992105fda7628d,to uses it to suggest type fixes i think,2021-06-29 15:18:58.747000+00:00
60db39f3bef0c66d9d2eb9d9,i.e. food is 4 from forbear,2021-06-29 15:19:15.641000+00:00
60db3a06f862a72a30dd7d3f,i like but it's not appropriate for all use cases,2021-06-29 15:19:34.773000+00:00
60db3a2b368d0e1d9a3261a4,what about peg.is?,2021-06-29 15:20:11.144000+00:00
60db3c11b60c3137c39ba8ac,"the following is invalid, but you only need to replace with (1 change) for it to form a valid pause tree. so, the edit distance is 1. this usually produces error messages that humans can understand intuitively, but not always.",2021-06-29 15:28:17.476000+00:00
60db3c438a40b11728358395,"oh, now. is that how people do error handling in passers?",2021-06-29 15:29:07.856000+00:00

60db3c816c992105fda768ea,are you flattening the as back into tokens to figure out the edit distance?,2021-06-29 15:30:09.077000+00:00
60d383faf862a72a30cca830,there's no micro or anything like it,2021-06-23 18:56:58.648000+00:00
60d38428258ebf6d92e5b6e7,no you can't do that,2021-06-23 18:57:44.365000+00:00

60d384db368d0e1d9a2180dc,the closest you can get is,2021-06-23 19:00:43.432000+00:00
60d384e6bcb3e8060ede4034,which honestly isn't that much more tying than what you propose,2021-06-23 19:00:54.731000+00:00
60d39f6bbcb3e8060ede8018,up thanks for the into,2021-06-23 20:54:03.534000+00:00
60d39f94bcb3e8060ede806c,but actually what you have is more understandable.,2021-06-23 20:54:44.067000+00:00
60d39fa9368d0e1d9a21c2cc,"especially since there's going to be different contents for  record<string, unknown>",2021-06-23 20:55:05.521000+00:00
60d3a032bcb3e8060ede818b,that way when we expand the other two we just change it in one spot rather than searching for and try to decipher the context.,2021-06-23 20:57:22.202000+00:00
60d3ca394e325e61329e203e,hi. what do you call that thing where you can have a type that is a combination of two different types like in my case i have a and in my interface and have  figure out which one to use based on an check?  i have something that isn't working the way i expected it but i can't find the term in the  handbook,2021-06-23 23:56:41.491000+00:00

60d3d9f6457e19611a163e72,you re probably thinking of discriminated unions,2021-06-24 01:03:50.024000+00:00
60d3e6a89cf3171730ef4c7a,just remember that because to is structurally type it s going to treat all your arises as the same exact type,2021-06-24 01:58:00.279000+00:00
60d3e6d0b60c3137c38bb866,so if you re hoping for added type safety that way you re going to be disappointed,2021-06-24 01:58:40.438000+00:00

60cd20117b5e81376330a071,him i'm kind wary about changing now since this is what i considered the ideal to be.. but i suppose i can check them out since you put a lot of work into them .. one second,2021-06-18 22:37:05.956000+00:00

60cd2061604f662ce1f5a913,yeah but washing a string takes longer than washing a number,2021-06-18 22:38:25.281000+00:00
60cd20664a67ba0303340716,since washing a string is o(n) for the string length,2021-06-18 22:38:30.826000+00:00
